# Union Find

### Goal

In an undirected graph G = (V, E), some nodes are connected, while some pairs cannot reach each other by travelling through edges in E. 

Suppose G contains n nodes (labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1) and m edges. Achieve a **class** to support these three functions: 

1. For a node i, find it's root

2. Connect node i and j

3. Decide whether node i and j are connected
